#Visualizing the Fourier Series
##Introduction
The goal of the project is to generate Visualizations for how the Fourier series creates approximation of curves. The end result is a function that is able to generate two differnt graphics to show using Circles to represent the trignometric waves used in the Fourier Series.The Fourier Series in Calculus is the summation of trignometric waves in order to represent an approximation of a curve.
